# Vintage Sailing Fortuitous
It was 1996. We did the best we could.  

## Premise
It is surprisingly hard to make a webpage look this bad in modern times. The Internet does not want to look like this anymore, and it must be forced in odd ways to make it happen. For example, like Rodney Dangerfield, the <blink> tag is no longer respected by browsers, so everything that needs to blink (for reasons) had to be converted to animated GIFs. You can't automatically play a MIDI file anymore...most browsers won't play MIDI at all, and it's harder than it once was to force weird beeps and bloops upon people, so I had to find a MIDI track, play it with a period-correct midi player, record the output as an MP3, then serve it with HTML5. The mid-90s were a simpler time.
